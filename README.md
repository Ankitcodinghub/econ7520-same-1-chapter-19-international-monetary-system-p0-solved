‚Ä¢ Internal balance describes the macroeconomic goals of producing at potential output (at ‚Äúfull employment‚Äù) and of price stability (low inflation).

‚Äì An unsustainable use of resources (overemployment) tends to increase prices; an ineffective use of resources (underemployment) tends to decrease prices.

‚Ä¢ Volatile aggregate demand and output tend to create Add volatile prices.

‚Äì Price-level movements reduce economy‚Äôs efficiency by making the real value of the monetary unit less certain and thus a less useful guide for economic decisions.

‚ñ™ For example, pressure on Japan in the 1980s and China in the 2000s.Add

‚Ä¢ An intertemporal budget constraint limits each country‚Äôs spending over time to levels that it can repay (with interest).

(3 of 3)

‚Ä¢ Such an event is called a sudden stop in foreign lending.

Can A Country Borrow Forever? The Case of New Zealand

‚Ä¢ New Zealand has run current account deficits every year for as far back as official statistics have been recorded.

‚Ä¢ Lenders continue to extend credit and do not seem worried about whether they will be repaid. ‚Ä¢ Appears that a country can borrow year after year without going broke, as long as does not borrow too much. Add

‚Ä¢ By holding net exports to GDP constant at the right value, a country (like New Zealand) with initial net foreign debt will perpetually run deficits in its current account while still maintaining a constant ratio of net foreign liabilities to national output.

New Zealand has consistently had a current account deficit for decades, yet its net foreign liabilities have averaged about 70 percent of GDP and have been falling in recent years. Source: Statistics New Zealand.

The Open-Economy Trilemma (1 of 2)

‚Ä¢ A country that fixes its currency‚Äôs exchange rate while allowing free international capital movements gives up control over domestic monetary policy. ‚Ä¢ A country that fixes its exchange rate can have control over domestic monetary policy if it restricts international

financial flows so that interest parity R R * need not hold.

Add

‚Ä¢ Or a country can allow international capital to flow freely and have control over domestic monetary policy if it allows the exchange rate to float.

The Open-Economy Trilemma (2 of 2)

‚Ä¢ Impossible for a country to achieve more than two items from the following list:

1. Exchange rate stability.

2. Monetary policy oriented toward domestic goals. 3. Freedom of international capital movements.

Add Figure 19.1 The Monetary Trilemma for Open

Economies

The vertices of the triangle show three features that policy makers in open economies would prefer their monetary system to achieve. Unfortunately, at most two can coexist. Each of the three policy regime labels along the triangle‚Äôs edges (floating exchange rate, fixed exchange rate, financial controls) is consistent with the two goals that it lies between in the diagram.

Macroeconomic Policy under the Gold Standard 1870‚Äì1914

‚Ä¢ The gold standard from 1870 to 1914 and after 1918 had mechanisms that prevented flows of gold reserves (the balance of payments) from becoming too positive or too negative.

‚Äì Prices tended to adjust according the amount of gold circulating in an economy, which had effects on the flows of goods and services: the current account.Add

‚Äì Central banks influenced financial asset flows, so that the non-reserve part of the financial account matched the current account in order to reduce gold outflows or inflows.

(1 of 5)

‚Ä¢ Price-specie-flow mechanism is the adjustment of prices as gold (‚Äúspecie‚Äù) flows into or out of a country, causing an adjustment in the flow of goods.

‚Äì An inflow of gold tends to inflate prices. ‚Äì An outflow of gold tends to deflate prices.

‚Äì If a domestic country has a current account surplus in excess of the non-reserve financial account, gold earned from exports flows into the country‚Äîraising prices in that country and Add lowering prices in foreign countries.

‚ñ™ Goods from the domestic country become expensive and goods from foreign countries become cheap, reducing the current account surplus of the domestic country and the deficits of the foreign countries.

(2 of 5)

‚Ä¢ Thus, price-specie-flow mechanism of the gold standard could automatically reduce current account surpluses and deficits, achieving a measure of external balance for all countries.

Add (3 of 5)

‚Ä¢ The Rules of the Game under the gold standard refer to another adjustment process that was theoretically carried out by central banks:

‚Äì The selling of domestic assets to acquire money when gold exited the country as payments for imports. This decreased the money supply and increased interest rates, attracting financial inflows to match a current account deficit.

‚ñ™ This reversed or reduced gold outflows.Add

‚Äì The buying of domestic assets when gold enters the country as income from exports. This increased the money supply and decreased interest rates, reducing financial inflows to match the current account.

‚ñ™ This reversed or reduced gold inflows. (4 of 5)

‚Ä¢ Banks with decreasing gold reserves had a strong incentive to practice the rules of the game: they could not redeem currency without sufficient gold. ‚Ä¢ Banks with increasing gold reserves had a weak incentive to practice the rules of the game: gold did not earn interest, but domestic assets did.

Add

‚Ä¢ In practice, central banks with increasing gold reserves seldom followed the rules. ‚Ä¢ And central banks often sterilized gold flows, trying to prevent any effect on money supplies and prices.

(5 of 5)

‚Ä¢ The gold standard‚Äôs record for internal balance was mixed. ‚Äì The United States suffered from deflation, recessions, and financial instability during the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s while trying to adhere to a gold standard.

‚Äì The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.8% on average from 1890 to 1913, but it was less than 5.7% on average from 1946 to 1992.Add

Interwar Years: 1918‚Äì1939

1944 at

$35.00 per ounce (a devaluation of the dollar).

‚Äì The United Kingdom reinstated the gold standard from

1925 to 1931. Add

‚Ä¢ But countries that adhered to the gold standard for the longest time, without devaluing their currencies, suffered most from reduced output and employment during the 1930s.

Bretton Woods System: 1944‚Äì1973

‚Äì a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and a fixed dollar price of gold ($35 per ounce).

‚Ä¢ They also established other institutions:

1. The International Monetary FundAdd

2. The World Bank

3. General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), the predecessor to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

International Monetary Fund (1 of 2)

‚Ä¢ The IMF was constructed to lend to countries with persistent balance of payments deficits (or current account deficits), and to approve of devaluations.

‚Äì Loans were made from a fund paid for by members in gold and currencies. ‚Äì Each country had a quota, which determined its contribution to the fund and the maximum amount it could Add borrow.

‚Äì Large loans were made conditional on the supervision of domestic policies by the IMF: IMF conditionality. ‚Äì Devaluations could occur if the IMF determined that the economy was experiencing a ‚Äúfundamental disequilibrium.‚Äù

International Monetary Fund (2 of 2)

‚Äì The volatility of exchange rates during 1918‚Äì1939,

caused by devaluations and the vagaries of the gold standard, was viewed as a source of economic Add instability.

Bretton Woods System (1 of 2)

‚Ä¢ In order to avoid sudden changes in the financial account (possibly causing a balance of payments crisis), countries in the Bretton Woods system often prevented flows of financial assets across countries. ‚Ä¢ Yet they encouraged flows of goods and services because of the view that trade benefits all economies.

Add

‚Äì Currencies were gradually made convertible (exchangeable) between member countries to encourage trade in goods and services valued in different currencies.

Bretton Woods System (2 of 2)

‚Ä¢ Under a system of fixed exchange rates, all countries but the United States had ineffective monetary policies for internal balance.

‚Ä¢ The principal tool for internal balance was fiscal policy (government purchases or taxes).

‚Ä¢ The principal tools for external balance were borrowing Add from the IMF, restrictions on financial asset flows, and infrequent changes in exchange rates.

Policies for Internal and External Balance (1 of 4)

‚Ä¢ Suppose internal balance in the short run occurs when production is at potential output or when ‚Äúfull employment‚Äù equals aggregate demand:

f

Add P

‚Ä¢ An increase in government purchases (or a decrease in taxes) increases aggregate demand and output above its full employment level.

‚Ä¢ To restore internal balance in the short run, a revaluation (a fall in E) must occur.

Policies for Internal and External Balance (2 of 4)

‚Ä¢ Suppose external balance in the short run occurs when the current account achieves some value X:

EP *

CA

‚Ä¢ An increase in government purchases (or a decrease in taxes) increases aggregate demand, output and income, decreasing the Add current account.

‚Ä¢ To restore external balance in the short run, a devaluation (a rise in E) must occur.

Figure 19.2 Internal Balance (II), External Balance

(XX), and the ‚ÄúFour Zones of Economic Discomfort‚Äù

The diagram shows what different levels of the exchange rate, E, and overall domestic spending, A, imply for employment and the current account. Along II, output is at its full-employment level, Y f . Along XX, the current account is at its target level, X.

Figure 19.3 Policies to Bring about Internal and

External Balance

Unless the currency is devalued and the level of domestic spending rises, internal and external balance (point 1) cannot be reached. Acting alone, a change in fiscal policy, for example, enables the economy to attain either internal balance (point 3) or external balance (point 4), but only at the cost of increasing the economy‚Äôs distance from the goal that is sacrificed.

Policies for Internal and External Balance (3 of 4)

‚Ä¢ But under the fixed exchange rates of the Bretton Woods system, devaluations were supposed to be infrequent, and fiscal policy was supposed to be the main policy tool to achieve both internal and external balance. ‚Ä¢ But in general, fiscal policy cannot attain both internal balance and external balance at the same time.

Add

‚Ä¢ A devaluation, however, can attain both internal balance and external balance at the same time.

Policies for Internal and External Balance (4 of 4)

‚Ä¢ Under the Bretton Woods system, policy makers generally used fiscal policy to try to achieve internal balance for political reasons. ‚Ä¢ Thus, an inability to adjust exchange rates left countries facing external imbalances over time.

Add

‚Äì Infrequent devaluations or revaluations helped restore external and internal balance, but speculators also tried to anticipate them, which could cause greater internal or external imbalances.

(1 of 3)

‚Ä¢ The collapse of the Bretton Woods system was caused primarily by imbalances of the United States during the 1960s and 1970s.

‚Äì The U.S. current account surplus became a deficit in

1971.

‚Äì Rapidly increasing government purchases increased aggregate demand and output, as well as prices.Add ‚Äì Rising prices and a growing money supply caused the U.S. dollar to become overvalued in terms of gold and in terms of foreign currencies.

(2 of 3)

‚Ä¢ Another problem was that as foreign economies grew, their need for official international reserves to maintain fixed exchange rates grew as well. ‚Ä¢ But this rate of growth was faster than the growth rate of the gold reserves that central banks held.

‚Äì Supply of gold from new discoveries was growing slowly.

‚Äì Holding dollar-denominated assets was the alternative.Add

‚Ä¢ At some point, dollar-denominated assets held by foreign central banks would be greater than the amount of gold held by the Federal Reserve.

(3 of 3)

‚Ä¢ The Federal Reserve would eventually not have enough gold: foreigners would lose confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to maintain the fixed price of gold at

$35/ounce, and therefore would rush to redeem their dollar assets before the gold ran out.

‚Äì If markets perceive that the central bank does not have enough official international reserve assets to maintain a fixed rate, a balance of payments crisis is inevitable.

(1 of 5)

‚Ä¢ The United States was not willing to reduce government purchases or increase taxes significantly, nor reduce money supply growth.

‚Ä¢ These policies would have reduced aggregate demand, output, and inflation and increased unemployment. ‚Äì The United States could have attained some semblance of external balance at a cost of a slower economy.Add

‚Ä¢ A devaluation, however, could have avoided the costs of low output and high unemployment and still have attained external balance (an increased current account and official international reserves).

(2 of 5)

‚Ä¢ The imbalances of the United States , in turn, caused speculation about the value of the U.S. dollar, which caused imbalances for other countries and made the system of fixed exchange rates harder to maintain.

‚Äì Financial markets had the perception that the

U.S. economy was experiencing a ‚Äúfundamental

disequilibrium‚Äù and that a devaluation would Add be necessary.

(3 of 5)

‚Äì Thereafter, individuals and private institutions were no longer allowed to redeem gold from the Federal Reserve or other central banks. Add ‚Äì The Federal Reserve would sell only to other central banks at $35/ounce.

(4 of 5)

‚Ä¢ Second, speculation about a devaluation of the dollar in terms of other currencies caused investors to buy large quantities of foreign currency assets.

(5 of 5)

‚Ä¢ The Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1973 because central banks were unwilling to continue to buy overvalued dollar-denominated assets and to sell undervalued foreign currency‚Äìdenominated assets.

‚Ä¢ In 1973, central banks thought they would temporarily

stop trading in the foreign exchange market and would let exchange rates adjust to supply and demand, and Add then would reimpose fixed exchange rates soon.

‚Ä¢ But no new global system of fixed rates was started again.

(1 of 6)

1. Monetary policy autonomy ‚Äì Without a need to trade currency in foreign exchange markets, central banks are more free to influence the domestic money supply, interest rates, and inflation.

‚Äì Central banks can more freely react to changes in aggregate demand, output, and prices in order to Add achieve internal balance.

Case for Floating Exchange Rates (2 of 6)

2. Automatic stabilization ‚Äì Flexible exchange rates change the prices of a country‚Äôs

products and help reduce ‚Äúfundamental disequilibria.‚Äù

‚Äì One fundamental disequilibrium is caused by an excessive increase in money supply and government purchases, leading to inflation, as we saw in the United States during

1965‚Äì1972. Add

‚Äì Inflation causes the currency‚Äôs purchasing power to fall, both domestically and internationally, and flexible exchange rates can automatically adjust to account for this fall in value, as purchasing power parity predicts. (3 of 6)

‚Äì Another fundamental disequilibrium could be caused by a change in aggregate demand for a country‚Äôs products.

‚Äì Flexible exchange rates would automatically adjust to stabilize high or low aggregate demand and output,

thereby keeping output closer to its normal level and

also stabilizing price changes in the long run. Add

Figure 19.5 Effects of a Fall in Export

Demand

Add

The response to a fall in export demand (seen in the shift from DD DD1 to 2) differs under floating and fixed exchange rates. (a) With a floating rate, output falls only to Y2 as the currency‚Äôs depreciation (form E E1 to 2) shifts demand back toward domestic goods. (b) With the exchange rate fixed at E1, output falls all the way to Y 3 as the

central bank reduces the money supply (reflected in the shift from AA AA1 to 2).

(4 of 6)

‚Äì In the short run and long run, a real depreciation of domestic products occurs through a nominal depreciation under flexible exchange rates.Add

‚Ä¢ Fixed exchange rates cannot survive for long in a world with divergent macroeconomic policies and other changes that affect national aggregate demand and national income differently.

(5 of 6)

‚Äì Fixed exchange rates are unsustainable if markets believe that the central bank does not have enough official international reserves.

Add (6 of 6)

4. Symmetry (not possible under Bretton Woods)

‚Äì The United States is now allowed to adjust its exchange rate, like other countries. ‚Äì Other countries are allowed to adjust their money

supplies for macroeconomic goals, like the United

States could. Add

Since 1973 (1 of 6)

‚Ä¢ In 1975, IMF members met in Rambouillet, France to allow flexible exchange rates, but to prevent ‚Äúerratic

fluctuations.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ In 1976 in Kingston, Jamaica, they amended the articles of agreement for IMF membership to formally endorse flexible rates,

Add

‚Äì but prevented members from ‚Äúmanipulating exchange rates ‚Ä¶ to gain an unfair competitive advantage‚Äù: no expenditure-switching policies were allowed.

‚Äì The articles allowed ‚Äúsurveillance‚Äù of members by other members to be sure they were acting fairly.

Since 1973 (2 of 6)

‚Äì This contributed to a growing current account deficit by making imports cheaper and U.S. goods more expensive. Add

‚Ä¢ To reduce the value of the US $, the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, and France announced in 1985 that their central banks would jointly intervene in the foreign exchange markets in order to reduce the value of the dollar. ‚Äì The dollar dropped sharply the next day and continued to drop as the United States continued a Add more expansionary monetary policy, pushing down interest rates. ‚Äì The agreement was called the Plaza Accords, because it was announced at the Plaza Hotel in New York.

inflation has been associated with greater currency depreciation. The exact relationship predicted by relative PPP, however, has not held for most countries. The

inflation difference on the horizontal axis is calculated as

using the exact relative PPP

1. Internal balance means that an economy enjoys normal output and employment and price stability.

2. External balance roughly means a stable level of official international reserves or a current account that is not too positive or too negative.

3. The gold standard had two mechanisms that helped to prevent

external imbalances: Add

‚Äì Price-specie-flow mechanism: the automatic adjustment of prices as gold flows into or out of a country. ‚Äì Rules of the game: buying or selling of domestic assets by central banks to influence flows of financial assets.

4. The Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 established fixed exchange rates, using the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency.

5. The IMF was also established to provide countries with financing for balance of payments deficits and to judge if changes in fixed rates were necessary.

6. Under the Bretton Woods system, fiscal policies were used to achieve internal and external balance, but they could not do both Add simultaneously, so external imbalances

often resulted.

7. Internal and external imbalances of the United States ‚Äîcaused by rapid growth in government purchases and the money supply‚Äîand

speculation about the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of gold and other currencies ultimately broke the Bretton Woods system.

8. High inflation from U.S. macroeconomic policies was transferred to other countries late in the Bretton Woods system.

9. Arguments for flexible exchange rates are that they allow monetary policy autonomy, can stabilize the economy as aggregate demand

and output change, and can limit some forms of speculation.

10. Arguments against flexible exchange rates are that they allow expenditure switching policies, can make aggregate demand and output more volatile because of uncoordinated

policies across countries, and make exchange rates more volatile.

11. Since 1973, countries have engaged in two major global efforts to influence exchange rates:

‚Äì The Plaza Accords reduced the value of the dollar relative to other major currencies.

‚Äì The Louvre Accords agreement was intended to stabilize exchange rates, but it was quickly abandoned.

12. Models of large countries account for the influence that domestic Add macroeconomic policies have in foreign countries.
